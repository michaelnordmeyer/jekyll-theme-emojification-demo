The colorful index is on. Posts belonging to different categories show up in the color of the category. The color has to be set manually in the page’s frontmatter, e.g. `theme_color: gold`.

Note: While black and white work well as theme colors, they don’t work well in colorful indexes with a colored main background. That’s because the main background has black text with white or black link underlines, which obviously clashes with black and white theme colors.
