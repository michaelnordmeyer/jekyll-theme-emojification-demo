The colorful index is on. Posts belonging to different categories show up in the color of their respective category. The color has to be set manually in the page’s frontmatter, e.g. `theme_color: gold`.

Note: While black and white work well as theme colors, they don’t work well in colorful indexes with a colored main background. That’s because the colored main background has black text with white or black link underlines, which obviously clashes with black and white theme colors.
