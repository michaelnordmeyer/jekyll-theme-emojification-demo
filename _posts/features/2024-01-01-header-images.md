# Header Images

The header image is the hero. But because we use emoji as a major design element, which is located above the title, the hero image has to go below. Not perfect.

In this theme it could have been a normal image at the beginning of a post, but the header image is also used for feeds and in SEO tags for richer embeds.

`alt` and `title` attributes are taken into account if they are set in the frontmatter.

This page’s relevant frontmatter:

```yaml
