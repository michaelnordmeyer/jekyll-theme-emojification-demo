An emoji has to be declared in frontmatter's `icon` or `_config.yml`â€™s `icon`. Itâ€™s just pasting it at the right place. Thatâ€™s it.

This pageâ€™s relevant frontmatter:

```yaml
---
icon: ðŸ¤©
---
```

This siteâ€™s relevant config:

```yaml
---
theme_settings:
  icon: ðŸŒ³
---
```


If thereâ€™s no `icon` in the frontmatter and no default icon set, then there will be no icon displayed and the home link wonâ€™t be click- or tapable anymore. Only the [access key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/accesskey) remains (h).

If icons for a limited number of pages should be hidden, [it can be done](/manual/hiding-icons) as well.

[Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) provides design views for a chosen emoji for many operating systems and software, as those look different on different platforms.
