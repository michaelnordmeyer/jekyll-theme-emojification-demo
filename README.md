# Jekyll Theme Emojification Demo

A demo site for [Jekyll Theme Emojification](https://github.com/michaelnordmeyer/jekyll-theme-emojification), a simple and minimal single-author theme with configurable big emoji as the header link, and configurable background colors, which can be chosen for each post or page.

[Demo](https://jekyll-theme-emojification.michaelnordmeyer.com/)

This demo shows several different color combinations and index page styles. Features, manuals, and sample colors are created as posts. Additional information can be found in the [theme's readme](https://github.com/michaelnordmeyer/jekyll-theme-emojification).

## Additional Features

Some features cannot applied automatically due to how Jekyll integrates remote themes. They have to be copied manually from this demo repository.

- Category pages
- Custom error pages
- An in-browser styled Atom feed through a feed XSLT, which is automatically applied by the `jekyll-feed` plugin. It educates people about feeds.
- An in-browser styled sitemap through a sitemap XSLT, which is automatically applied by the `jekyll-sitemap` plugin. Probably only the site owner might look at it every once in a while.
